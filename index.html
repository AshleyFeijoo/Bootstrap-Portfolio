                      <p>"Now, this is a story all about how
                          My life got flipped-turned upside down
                          And I'd like to take a minute
                          Just sit right there
                          I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
                
                          In west Philadelphia born and raised
                          On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                          Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                          And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                          When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                          Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                          I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                          She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
                          I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                        But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
                        She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
                        I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
                
                        First class, yo this is bad
                        Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
                        Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                        Hmm this might be alright.
                
                        But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
                        Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
                        I don't think so
                        I'll see when I get there
                        I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air</p>
